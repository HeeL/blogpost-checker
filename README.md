This is a github plugin or github App based on [probot](https://probot.github.io/). It checks if PR with jekyll blogpost is not too old.  
Sometimes it happend that you start to write a blogpost and it takes too long before it gets merged. You are most likely don't want to have publish date to be set to the date when you started to write that blogpost.
