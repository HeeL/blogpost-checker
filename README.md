# too-old-blogpost-check

This is a GitHub App built with [probot](https://probot.github.io/). It checks if PR with a new jekyll blogpost is not too old.  
Sometimes it happend that you start to write a blogpost and it takes too long before it gets merged. You are most likely don't want to have publish date to be set to the date when you started to write that blogpost.

## Setup

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run test
npm test

# Run the bot
npm start

# Run the bot in dev mode with hot reload
npm dev:start
```

See [docs/deploy.md](docs/deploy.md) if you would like to run your own instance of this app.
